[ITCSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4) (Inverted Triangle CSS) from Harry Roberts, is a way of structuring CSS in such a way that the most general selectors to trickle down to the most specific selectors, as if they're moving from the top of an bottom of a triangle to the pinnacle of it.

In this implementation there are a few differences. Normally in ITCSS, you could have a tools like Sass functions, but most of the tools we'd need are coming in CSS and transpiled by [PostCSS plugins](https://postcss.org/).

Objects have minimal visual styling in Obsidian. This is a set between the reset styling and the component level styling because it's beyond an element.

Settings contain base styles but often module variables are only contained in that module; there are a few exceptions (like shadow values).
